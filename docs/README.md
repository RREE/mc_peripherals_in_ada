## Welcome to Micro Controller Peripherals in Ada

This site lists various micro-controller boards that can be used with the programming language Ada. Currently we are focused on AVR boards as we have an Ada compiler only for these processors.  We are planning to extend it to also cover ESP8266 and ESP32 boards.

### Boards

- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Nano V3
- ESP-01

### AVR Internal Units

- 8bit Timers
- 16bit Timers
- UART for Serial Communication
- Analog/Digital Converter

### Input Devices

- Key

### Output Devices

- LED

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RREE/mc_peripherals_in_ada/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
